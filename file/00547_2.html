<p>head waiter & all here are aghast, as it was the first news they had had of conditions as they really <u>were</u> on the boat.</p>
<p>Were it not that I <u>must</u> be back in N.Y. on the 1st Oct., I would stay here too.</p>
<p>Personally, I have no right to complain, as I calmly + brazenly threw the fear of J. P. into them & they have given me a <u>suite</u> de gran lusso of bedroom sitting room & large bath but the others are suffering badly. It will all be a boomerang for themforall the newspapers will have the story shortly after our arrival. How I miss bothyoudears. B.G.</p>
