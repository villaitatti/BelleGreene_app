<p>Dearest B.B –</p>
<p>So many thanks for your two letters which I found here on my arrival last night – an <u>utterly</u> exhausted human specimen. The passage was extraordinarily fine, but if I poked my head of out of my stateroom I was talked to death & the fog-horn, the last 14 hours <u>almost</u> drove me insane – The advice I have received of the intercepted R.R. service taken in conjunction with your letters, has decided me to proceed to London – I therefore plan to leave here on the 12th – but shall not be surprised to find at the last moment that there is no <s>train</s> [^boat^] service –</p>
<p>I shall probably <u>have</u> to get to Rome by April 15th at the latest and hope to be able to get accomodations [sic] at the Excelsior or Grand – Please thank</p>
