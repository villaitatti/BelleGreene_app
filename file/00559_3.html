<p>of times to meet Eric Maclagan at luncheon or dinner, but have only accomplished it once or twice for the same reason – He's been good enough however to drop in the Library when he could and I like and admire him a good deal, but I feel sure that he does not <u>return</u> it, in equal degree – </p>
<p>I have had a <u>filthy</u> cold every time I have seen him, so I am sure he wonders <u>why</u> anyone has ever spoken to him about that 'snotty-nosed' woman! Too bad – because I am sure that under proper circumstances (which means given a week's rest, for me) we would have been good friends – However – a number of our mutual English friends who have been over here, insist that they will bring us properly together while I am in England. He goes back the end of this month – and it would be fun to know what he thinks of us – our institutions – our collections etc. On the other hand – it would be fun to intimate</p>
