<p>lunch every day if I had been willing to go – I really thought him <u>quite</u> a nuisance until his innate, well bred kindness this morning.</p>
<p>Don't think that <u>I</u> think there is any crush about it because he is still [^somewhat^] crushed on the Blond Terror & <u>fairly</u> faithful to his wife – He told me in detail his life's story but, he is very much afraid of being chaffed </p>
<p>[p. 5]</p>
<p>so please never hint that I told you anything and if, as I really think you <u>are</u> fond of him, never tease him about friend Gladys or mention her name. He was <u>really</u> badly hurt & his friends ought to help him by never mentioning the incident – </p>
<p>Three people here, told me that you had been <u>desperately</u> in love with her, and that she had ruined your life – <u>Why</u> – oh! B(est) B(eloved) didn't you tell <u>me</u>? I would have forgiven you and loved you just the same.</p>
