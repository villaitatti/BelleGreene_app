<p>after the war – the League of Nations – Bolshevikism and Labor – </p>
<p>Even <s>with my</s> my material and "acting-instead-of-thinking" self can understand your desire to be apart from it all and one with the rocks and trees – Do you suppose there has <u>ever</u> been one worth while person who has not had that desire?</p>
<p>In Amurrica, however, one <u>cannot </u>get away from the bang and clash & clatter of it all – Only when I am safely locked up all alone in the Library do I cease to worry it all to bits. Of course we have all been so bedevilled & maddened by our great W.W. – <s>that</s> we cannot see the League of Nations as we should and realize the great ideal back of it</p>
