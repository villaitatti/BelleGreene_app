<p>oncial [sic] leaves - I adore them & gloat over them like an idiot over a bauble – I bought for myself 4 [<i>tripe underlined</i>: divine]Kuficleaves last week – One of the few great beauties I’ve ever seen – evidently from someone’s special Koran – and the day before I began to flower into flu, I weakly bought (also for this little phul) a XVII cent book of prayers – all in gold letters – Very pretty – done for  that gent who builtthe TajMahal(know it isn’t spelled that way) – I was sorterdrunkat the time (5 p.m.!) after a roussing [sic]& soussingluncheon which put 3 friends on board the Mauretania,sailing at 4 – & so paid too much for it – $300 – and only $100 for those glorious Kufics</p>
<p>So I consider myself – striking an average – some $100 to the bad -Stillits a <u>glowingly</u> pretty thing like Mrs. Cushing was in the days of husband – also I got me one day a nice XIII cent French (Paris) initial which I’ll send on to you as a book mark– of coursethrow it away at once if you like – as I do most of the presents sent to me – </p>
<p>I hear that Duveen is in a hell of arowwith Bachstitzover that marvellous Rogierv. d. Weydenwoman’s head – If I had a soul worth anything, I’d sell it for that portrait </p>
