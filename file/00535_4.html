<p>want to profit by it. So do that for me without fail, won’t you – My address in <u>Venice</u> (August 5) will be the Grand Hotel on the Canal – and I expect to hear from you there too – I dare say I shall [<i>double underline</i>: roast] in Naples – but I don’t care –</p>
<p>I am so much looking forward to it – I just could not wait another moment after reading your letters from there –</p>
<p> I am planning to spend 4 or 5 days at Verona – 2 or 3 at Padua and 4 at least at Ravenna – and won’t try to do anything more –</p>
<p>You’re a <u>MEANIE </u>not to have made me one of the high muckie mucks of the Harvard-I Tatti – so that I would have had a <u>valid</u> excuse for going to Italy every year – If I had 10 cents I would buy a hole in the ground there – but no such luck for me –</p>
<p><u>Be sure</u> to write me to Naples and I’m so DAMN PROUD of You!</p>
