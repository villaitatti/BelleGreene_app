<p>Geoffrey Scott for infidelity – Pretty cheeky of her isn’t it, from all the tales I’ve heard – But I dare say she settled a good sum upon him which may save you from doing that same– </p>
<p>Billee Ivins wrote me a most extraordinary account of a motortripwith you to Vallombrosa–It was very wonderful truly & when he comes back I’m going to make him incorporate that & some other brilliant bitshe has writtenduring his tripinto a few essays– They are <u>miles</u>ahead of anything which appears in the journalsover here – I think he got more out of that drive and the tea time in the “valley of Virgil & Ovid as he called it (onlybetter than that) than anything else at I Tatti except You, whom he adores – even while you consume his entire attention with wonderings & speculations, I suggested to him that he allow himself to utterly relax when with you, into utter, somnolent (if necessary) adoration of you – in which event he would be able to actually ‘<u>get</u>’ you – that he would find you quietly graciously seeping<u>into</u> him, just as some rarely beautiful thing does, if You are receptively quiet before it & don’t muddle up the intervening atmosphere with queries & speculations – I know he’ll come right back at me with “<u>Do</u> [<i>double</i><i>underlined</i>: you?]” – and I’m going to answer “Yes – when he’s not playing the emasculated Pasha to a bunch of nonnentities in the guise of females” – </p>
<p>It would do Billee, a <u>world</u> of good to be with you ([<i>quadruple underlined</i>: alone!]) for a month or so – but certainly <u>not </u></p>
