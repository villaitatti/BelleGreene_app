<p>moment to be sure he is not doing this – Mind you – he [<i>underlined twice</i>: is] honest. He has no intention of "stealing" <u>whatever</u>, and if I- or you – were to accuse him 'of the purpose' of stealing the product of your brain and your years of research, I really think he would murder us on the spot- The point is that he is <u>obsessed</u> with publishing facts. He has told me again & again that all information of any kind is public property – or should be made so <u>over his signature!</u></p>
<p>I very much believe – and I certainly do <u>not</u> hate him – that he could not resist passing on to <u>his note books</u> as much as he has time to do so, at Settignano. </p>
<p><u>If</u> you don't care about all this – go right ahead & employ him (pay him as <u>little</u> as possible – because he realizes that <u>he</u> is getting the advantage at Settignano) –</p>
<p>Anyhow <u>if</u> he's the man you want – go ahead anyhow – I <u>know</u> that he will not turn out to be the vindictive ungrateful kind – and I know that he really stands <u>very</u> much in awe of your reputation and "glory" I'm</p>
