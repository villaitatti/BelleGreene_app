<p>Library three days & then was not well enough to see any one, so I have neither news nor gossip to pass on –</p>
<p>I'm disgusted (personally) with the conduct of the Republicans in convention in Chicago – Harding is, I understand, a rather sane & conservative man, but rather a tool of Lodge – Anything however was preferable to Johnson Wood or Lowden – I am keen to see who will run on the Democratic ticket – However I am firmly convinced that <u>no</u> Democrat could win </p>
