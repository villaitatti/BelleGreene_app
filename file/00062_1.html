<p>Tuesday March <u>29</u>.</p>
<p>Dearest this is just an au-revoir line for I am in a beastly hurry – I promised to be at Mr. Altman’s at four o’clock to see some new things & it is now 4:30 and I fear the poor little thing will be standing on his head – I will write you all about his new things by my next letter. I am hoping now to get down to Hot Springs next</p>

<p>Saturday but am not at all sure as I am so crowded up with Engagements here which I really ought to keep – Tonight we are going to the New Theatre to see Edith Wynne Matthison in Maeterlinck’s Sister Beatrice (John Davidson’s Ballad of a Nun). She is one of my great pals & I like every thing she does – We are having the <u>most</u> enchanting weather, the Spring is working [sic] havoc with me as usual – I dread it always – if you were <u>only</u> here or I were only there <u>anywhere</u> So we were together Yours. <u>Belle</u>.</p>
