<p>Monday</p>
<p>Dearest B.B – </p>
<p>I got no further than the enclosed at an attempt to you while week-ending at the Holford’s & will try to write now before I must dress for dinner with the Morgans – I had a <u>most</u> delightful time at the Holfords although one were only a small party (in that [<i>double underlined:</i> huge] house with its 16,000 + acreage!) as Lord Grey was ill & Lord & Lady Crawford were caught somewhere in the storm – We tramped in the snow & motored to tea to Badminton</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>& some “titles” came in for dinner – I saw all the pictures & was quite<u>mad</u> about a few of them, notably 2 full length Van Dycks, 2 Titian’s, a small profile head of a girl with light blond hair tightly pulled back which looked like a Domenico Veneziano to me, 2 fine Rembrandts (a self portrait & one of his mother) a splendid Rubens sketch, a fine small Perugino (???) and the [<i>double underlined</i>: finest] Cuyp I have ever seen although I do not much care for Cuyp in <u>any</u> condition. We spent hours looking at his orchids – they say he has the finest collection in</p>
