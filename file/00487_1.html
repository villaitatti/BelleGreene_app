<p>Dear B. B. – </p>
<p>I found your letters of April 28, 30 and May 2 – awaiting me on my return. They could not have arrived before the 21st. (3 weeks en route!) as all personal mail was forwarded to me </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>

We consume less than when you are here – I am to have a gentleman for dinner tonight but provide for him out of my own pocket book. I'll attend to it </p>
