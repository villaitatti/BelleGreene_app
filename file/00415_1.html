<p>Monday, <u>Oct</u> . 23</p>
<p>Dearest B.B –</p>
<p>As I telegraphed you this morning, I have only just received your two letters – They came together & as there is [ <i>double underlined:</i> no] way of telling the date from those Italian scratches called postmarks – I – of course, read the later one first – They threw me into a dreadful quandary – although I realized immediately that London was hopeless – not only must I be</p>
<p>constantly on the jump for business reasons but I dare not hope for much privacy – Everything is under watchful eyes, of necessity as I can well understand and to <u>add</u> to my troubles they told me this morning <u>after</u> I had telephoned you that the house was <u>packed</u> and crowded and that every room (mine included) had been taken months ahead for the winter. You see my plans were made (I must say <u>for me</u> ) at such short notice</p>
