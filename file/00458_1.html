<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>It seems to me a beastly long time since I have written to you – I have been laid up in so far as any exercise or writing is concerned – To my everlasting shame I was thrown from a polo pony in a try out game – and so badly twisted my right arm & ankle that I have only been able to sit or lie around and read – The pain did not bother me much but the disgrace was considerable –</p>
<p>I am so glad that you enjoyed the Eumos & their collection – I think they are both great dears – I'm sorry you did not especially notice my pet bronze owl – I think it certainly </p>
