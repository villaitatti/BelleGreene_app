<p>I have <u>never</u> seen –</p>
<p>Marie Louise went off a week or so ago to join her mother at Aix – She is ever so grateful for all you did for her, especially for your patience with her – and you have a very devoted, if not very important, friend in her –</p>
<p>I presume you are still at Vallambrosa [sic] – It must be cold there, as it is very cool here –</p>
<p>I saw Martha Hyde once before she left –</p>

<p>dined with her – she had some ever so attractive people – but – I am choked – mobbed, by people here – The place is full of Americans & English and it takes much manoeuvering to get rid of them – Bibesco has been gaily amusing, but has gone off to Roumania now – the Roumanian show here is rather interesting – I am sending you photographs and a few catalogues & books of it –</p>
<p>I <u>adore</u> the modern </p>
