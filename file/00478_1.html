<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>Every moment since my last writing has been more than fully occupied – largely with people or matters of <s>little</s> [^no^] interest to you –</p>
<p>I keep increasingly well and, probably in consequence, increasingly happy in an [^impersonally^] joyous interested way – It may probably be due to the unusually <u>glorious</u> weather we have been having – It keeps me on steadily buoyant tiptoe.</p>
<p>I have gone to see René</p>
