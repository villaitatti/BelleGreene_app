<p>one collector down by promising the strictest secrecy, so you must <u>not</u> give me away or I can never learn anything more for you – It seems that the story of Agrew's 'not-true' Antonello has gone about rather widely and that the collectors (unless they are <u>Duveen</u> pictures) think that you want photographs only to attribute or dis-attribute their pictures – They all claim that you never saw Agrew's "Antonello" and wrote the article <u>just from</u> the <u>photograph</u> and without any reason – I took the opportunity when I saw Colin Agrew at the Lehman's of asking him if to his knowledge you had <u>ever</u> seen his painting. He <u>swore</u> you had <u>not</u> – so will you please now tell</p>
