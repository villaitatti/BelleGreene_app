<p>and were so delighted when you broke the record–</p>
<p>I spend all my waking hours (and for the same reason all my hours <u>are</u> waking) with the dentist – who has so acted upon my strength and nerves that I have been forced to decline all invitations of any kind and have led the Simple Life for three days – I rather like it and think I will continue for a while at least – I am impatient to hear from you – to hear you say a thousand and one things to me – to have you tell me that you felt me with you every minute – I kiss your eyes your hair & your dear dear mouth –</p>
<p>Belle –</p>
