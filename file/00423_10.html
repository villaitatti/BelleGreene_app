<p>The man wears his wedding ring on his <u>head</u> &the woman on her breast – most interesting&a bit futuristic –</p>
<p>I can hardly write on this vile train – don’t know <u>how</u> you are going to read it – what a dreadful time it takes for letters to go to&from Paris – How I wish I were going to have a few weeks there – a friend of mine came over from there last week</p>
<p>[p. 16]</p>
<p>and he says they are all <u>very</u> optimistic&think the war will be over by Spring – but not I – Now I really must stop as this trying to hold down the paperinthis rickety rackety train is driving me mad – All my love to you dearest – I will write again next Monday – You can write to me at Claridges up to the 19th – After that S.S St. Louis Liverpool – sailing Nov. 25</p>
<p>Devotedly yours,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
