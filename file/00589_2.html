<p>I plan to leave here for Dresden on the 8th – and to leave Munich on the 17th – enroute to B.B. (foolish people call it Salzburg)</p>
<p>I had to leave the Esplanade as I stupidly had not told them how long I wanted to stay when I engaged the rooms from New York – </p>
<p>By the grace of God – this delightful apartment was free as Goldschmidt is on his way to U.S.A – to receive a degree at the Harvard Ter –etc<i>. </i>I am <u>so</u> much happier here – A sort of lady-housekeeper, and an <u>excellent</u> servant (I would pay her 4 times – if I could get her) – [<i>double underlined</i>: all] the Art Ref books in the world – make for every comfort – I am enjoying Berlin enormously – Crowdsare pouring in, and by Saturday I dare say the place will be a madhouse & for a week after I leave – but I will like that also – for it was like a Tomb when I arrived. </p>
<p>Bitte – R.S.V.P. – P.D.L – Belle</p>
