<p><u>Wednesday Sept. 22</u></p>
<p>Dearestest – I received this morning your letter of Sept. 12-13 and found them as usual fascinatingly interesting – I am terribly amused by your description of Mrs. Jordan Mott and will "relate" you what I know of her – To begin with she has no end of money – her husband being the owner of the great Mott iron works here – She has none too good </p>
<p>[p. 2] </p>
<p>a reputation, but is more <u>or less</u> accepted because her adventures have always been with the Great – she is quite boastfully frank about her relations with the Kaiser – she told me a good bit about them herself – He seems to like her enormously and it is a fact that she is often on his yacht with him or he meets her on Allison Armour's yacht – I think I told you all about my little "affaire"</p>
