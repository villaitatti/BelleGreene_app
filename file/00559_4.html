<p>to him what some of all of these think of him, his lectures etc – although I must truthfully say that I, personally, do <u>not</u> agree with them - I only heard one of his lectures (on Desiderio da Settig) and found it both scholarly and illuminating – <u>albeit</u> – that it would not produce another ache in my system if D. da S. had <u>never</u> lived! –</p>
<p>I <u>am</u> so damned tired of almost all of these people after – well – after about 1200 – I know that sounds stupid and girlish, but just the same I mean it – Have you ever seen anything of theirs that gives you <u>the swift kick</u> that most of the other things do? (Now, be honest, just with me, and tell me)</p>
<p>I've <u>quite</u> fallen in love with Goldschmidt – <u>perhaps</u> because he is of the harmless age – but he is one of the really <u>great</u> scholars (in his line) whom I have met – He has a clear, direct knowledge, unhampered by any 'isms' – and a truly amazing memory – Beside that - he has an <u>enchanting</u>, 'kris kringle' sense of humour. </p>
