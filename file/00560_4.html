<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>to dive into all the work that is awaiting me at the Library tomorrow (Monday) and I rather dread the organizing and running of the new building in addition to <u>my</u> building (which J.P.M & I now have to ourselves) – All the staff, Miss Thurston included have been bundled over into the adjoining building which will be the Reference Department of the Library. So, after having made my daily rounds & inspection of the working classes and their work, I will be in <u>comparative</u> peace & quiet in 33. </p>
<p>I have heard little or no news as yet as most of my friends are still away. Well old Dear no more at present as 'they' say. I have just come back from taking Bobby up to the Riggs school, where he will stay for about 5 years to prep for Groton- and as it was a 4 ½ hour motor trip each way, I'm a bit weary.</p>
<p>Do dish all the dirt for me artistic & otherwise </p>
