<p>and in that same article your lovely check on “the Byzantine question[”]) – I was indeed glad to see the engravings of the 2 “other” wings – but me eyes must be failing (or blinded by colour!) for I just cannot <u>entirely</u> fit them in with the rest of the panel – Was it – they – all in 1 piece – or 5 panels? (You probably answered that in your article – but I’ve forgotten)</p>
