<p>Loeser wrote me that he had been dining with you and that you seemed tired. (probably tired of <u>him</u> !) For some reason, he wrote me a rather wonderful letter – By the time I finished reading it, I realized that he had got me mixed up with QueenVictoria – He must have some fine streak in him to be able even to <u>phrase</u> such a letter – No mush or sloppiness – as he so often has –</p>
<p>I went to the Lehmans the other night to see Bobbie’s Piero – and (they had a large lunch for dinner) the conversation turned on you –</p>
<p>They admitted that you <u>were</u> IT, but tearfully regretted the fact – Colin</p>
