<p>know of, and know personally, Davison, Lamont, Stettinius etc</p>
<p>While J.P. remains an unknown (ergo – in the American mind) an unimportant "lay" figure – <s>of course</s>, <s>in time</s> However, I am willing to wager that in 10 years – perhaps less – he will be recognized as a greater force – internationally – than his father ever was – He will never be a myth (except at tea parties!) but he <u>will</u> be a <u>fact</u>.</p>
<p>Well I did not start out with the intention of writing a book about J.P no one knows his fun, but real limitations more than I. who fight them (and his charming wife's influence in encouraging them) every day</p>
<p>I am not going to the Library this morning – J.P. is in Washington and I am resting in bed, patiently and uncomplainingly accepting </p>
