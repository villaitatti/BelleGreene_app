<p>[p. 1]</p>
<p>Wednesday night</p>
<p>B.B. you Dear – I’ve been enjoying a week of flu – there must be some very healthy bug of it in my system, because I give over a week to it every year – But there has been a regular epidemic of the damned old plague here this year – Grippe, Flu and Pneumonia – so they put me to bed.</p>
<p>I feel as if I had been to China – or some lost and forgotten island in the Pacific for I haven’t seen anyone but my personal maid (who <u>really</u> adores me and would not be kept out of the room) and the old phul of a doctor</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>Up to today my eyes had been pouring such steady streams that I could neither read nor write – and so today I’ve had an <u>orgy</u> of mail which had accumulated for 5 days or more –</p>
<p>Your very interesting notes about the photographs of the miniatures I sent you came–When I get back to the Library on Friday, I will ‘check you up’ (the GALL of the hussy) but in the meantime, I found the <u>signature</u> of themanwho did that funny Trinity one (you referred him to Tacoan [?]p. 528 I <u>think</u> ) I did not get soawfulforintranscribing it before I was laid low, but think I can finish the job up neatlyon Friday</p>
<p>So glad you loved my</p>
