<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p><u>Some</u> day, I am going to sit up straight at my desk and write you a real <u>pen</u> letter â€“ as it is I am as usual "scribbling" to you in bed.</p>
<p>I took 2 of your letters away with me this Summer, to answer on the long idle days at sea (I lay on a boat for 50 odd days!) but alas the idleness grew upon </p>
