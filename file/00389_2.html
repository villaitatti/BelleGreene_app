<p>that means disaster – we do <u>not</u> want to go to war. That is no one does except Roosevelt and he, as usual, shot off his mouth before the President had a chance to say a word – we feel that both England and Germany are trying to pull us in it for their own ends and we don't want to go in  – we want to maintain our rights as a neutral nation and President Wilson's message will at last have that effect of showing whether such rights are to be respected hereafter or ignored. We are all anxiously waiting to see what Germany will do – most of the papers seem to think she will take a middle course the world thinks she will turn us down & thus insult us again the papers however are for the <u>first</u> time during the war, <u>unanimous</u> in their anti-German attitude and even the Stoats-Zeebring comes out and says that in case of trouble between this country & Germany all German-Americans will stand by and fight for America. </p>
<p>As to Italy I truly think that she has shamed herself before the world – Her wobbling commercial attitude is highly disgusting – I <u>do</u> wish you were safely away from there and think it is positively stubborn of you not to come over here</p>
