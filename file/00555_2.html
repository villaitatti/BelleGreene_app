<p>you some photos of MSS. of <s>slight</s> some slight interest –</p>
<p><u>[</u><i>underlined twice:</i>Confidentiallyto you] all of the Holford MSS. have been offered to us, but there are only 3 (and 2 single leaves) which we either want or need – and of these, the British Museum wants 1 – and I am so stupidly fond of all the men there, that I shall probably refuse this (which I <u>most</u> want!) in order that they may get it at a low price.</p>
<p>I <u>may</u> have to go to that g–d– {<s>Germany</s> & [^Austria^] this summer as all the Archdukes seem to want to sell everything they own & there are a <u>few</u> books and MSS. in the various collections</p>
