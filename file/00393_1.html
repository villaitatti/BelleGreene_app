<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>Your letter of Sept. 28th awoke me at last to a full realization of my "backsliding" – I really do not know how to explain to you the lethargy of melancholy in which I have been all the summer – I have gone through my work and am living during that time in a truly somnambulistic state – for the most part hating existence and in my </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>happiest moments ignoring it – I really think it is all due to the war – it got into my system and <u>into</u> my nerves and it is a regular occurence [sic] for me to awake once at least during the night from some horrible nightmarish dream dream [sic] of it all – I could not endure the idea of seeing anybody or going anywhere and my few best friends have just about given me up – I have not written a (personal) line to anybody since I last wrote you</p>
