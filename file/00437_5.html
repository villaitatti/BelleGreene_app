<p>man I have ever known – You must admit, Belovedest, <u>that</u> cannot be said of you any more than of<u> me</u> – Gawd knows I never <u>pretended</u> even to be faithful – at least physically –</p>
<p><u>Later</u></p>
<p>We've had a crab hunt and a bonfire lunch on the beach – Oh! it was quite wonderful – I feel <u>at least </u>50 years younger and so gorgeously full of ozone! I think I'll just throw up my job in a year or two and buy an Island somewhere and live there all alone – or à deux – for at least six months of the year – </p>
<p>I can't bear to think of going back to the city in a day or two – lunching at the Ritz with a male – or a female simply because I have no other "date" and all the rest – I suppose that in time, I would simply insist upon coming back to it – but in my present mood – I'd throw it all up for some years to myself – to wander about</p>
