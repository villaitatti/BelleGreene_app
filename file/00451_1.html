<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>Since writing you last my plans have crystallized and I leave here on the 11th for Paris – and from there on the 13th for Rome – I believe I am due there some time around midnight on the 14th.</p>
<p>I have wired the Excelsior for rooms but cannot be sure of anything</p>

<p>– I <u>must</u> get on the job in Rome first and foremost, and I honestly cannot tell from here how long it will take me to look things over and perhaps straighten things out –</p>
<p>Now <u>please</u> do whatever is <u>best</u> for your health and comfort – If you cannot get to Rome <s>the</s> I will manage <u>somehow</u> to get to I Tatti if only for a weekend –</p>
<p>A miserable collection has</p>
