<p>Sunday, <u>Jan. 10, 1915</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>My real “heart” thanks for your letters which have literally kept me <u>alive</u> during the past ten days – Please accept that from me as a <u>fact</u> , no matter. how much it may astonish you. I haveslept scarcely two hours a night during that time and all my waking hours have been so surcharged with excitement that at this minute I ought to be somewhere undergoing a rest cure. – all because that damned Fairfax Murray was paid <s>to</s> $50,000 to do something which he did not do – and which, as I prophesied when he first came over, I would eventually have to do – namely the disposing of these damned art objects. You may say that I am very foolish to work myself into either a sanatorium</p>
