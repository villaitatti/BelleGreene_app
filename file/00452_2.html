<p>very bad I shall stay over for another month or more and sail by the Olympic on June 25th – I have already cabled this to N.Y. – so all will be serene there. <u>Then</u> I can go to Siena, Assisi, Monte Cassino & all the other places I have missed so far –</p>
<p>The Johnsons caught me yesterday and utterly wasted and ruined two glorious hours – In his really simple way – he is dreadfully conceited about the people he has met – and she, as usual, is too lispingly dull for words – what utter, wooly idiots they are – Having lived in next to nothing at home, they are now doubly concerned as to how they can <u>manage</u> on $27500 <u>per year</u>. –</p>
<p>I dined with Cerelli last night & a propos of something, he mentioned Keynes book – I asked him if he had read it and he replied that he had made a brief résumé of it in Italian for the Pope – He then told me that he had met Keynes at Gasquet's & had taken a strong liking to him. I refrained from boasting that I also had met the great man –</p>
