<p>know how slow and slothful they are in that dead place – </p>
<p>Sherman gave me a complete set of the Italians some time ago – but they are mounted, fancy brownish things, which would be of no interest to you – He told me at the time that he had another set which he thought of selling to Helen Frick. I <u>think</u> he said the cost was $125. – If he has not already sold it, do you want it? Wish I could present it to you but I have not seen that amount of money for ages!</p>
