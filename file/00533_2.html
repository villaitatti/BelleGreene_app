<p>there? I think that she was planning to go about this time – Lots of people have come over here this month, Mildred Bliss – the Grenfell’s – that <u>awfully</u> nice Esher – do you know him? – & slews of others – I have been sorter lazy with em – when I knew ‘em well enough making em come and talk to me as I stretched out in bed (but believe me DARLINT – <u>beautifully</u> draped!) They are all sailing again, in June & I’ll be awfully glad to be quiet for a while –</p>
<p>I had a [ <i>double underlined</i> :vile] disease commonly called grippe or flu – I only stayed in bed 4 or so days which it seems was a great mistake, because I have literally just <u>dragged</u> around ever since. It’s like leprosy – without any outward marks to incite sympathy or pity. So I’ve cut out all the evening things I possibly could – and have read myself blind in the times when I have been able to free myself of “sitters” –</p>
<p>Are you expecting to be at I Tatti in July or August? I have told Kirsopp Lake –olimOxon … nuncHarv… to be sure to look you up there – He’s one of my good friends – a really great Greek Biblical man with a grand and <u>low</u> sense of humour – He edited & published the Sinai Codex & he’s now</p>
