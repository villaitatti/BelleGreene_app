<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>This is only a horrid scrawl to say that I have had to postpone my sailing until the end of February or early in March –</p>
<p>My mother and sister now have taken very suddenly ill – mother with evidences of Typhoid (they are not <u>certain </u>of it at this writing) and my sister has just undergone a <u>most</u> serious operation (yesterday) we do not know yet if she is out of danger – So you can see I could not <u>think</u> of leaving –</p>
<p>Do not plan to meet me in Rome on my <u>first</u> trip there</p>
