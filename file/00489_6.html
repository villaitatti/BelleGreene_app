<p>as one of the Trustees of his gallery, after his death. The request was made without any preliminary talk and I was startled by it and blurted out <u>no</u> – that it was utterly impossible – I could not do it – did not know enough etc. and definitily [sic] refused it <u>twice</u>. When I saw the list of Trustees and realized that none of them knew any <u>more</u> than I did and had not had half the Experience, I was a bit regretful.</p>
<p><u>Now</u> – one of the Trustees has come to me and says – "<u>If</u> a vacancy should occur within the next year or so – (evidently he expects someone to resign) and <u>if</u> my name were unanimously seconded by the remaining Trustees, <u>would</u> I accept the place"?</p>
