<p>DERE B.B – </p>
<p>I started this on the very <u>grandest</u> stationary [sic], but I had too much to say, to continue turning pages!</p>
<p>I've (honestly) thought of you during all the time I have not written – either to you – or to anybody – I'm just no good at all as a correspondent – </p>
<p>I was about to say that I had been so ghastly busy etc. etc. etc. but having paused with pencil in air for a moment, I was forced to realize how absurd (except for the purpose of earning enough to keep a roof over my head and such body covering as the laws & morals of this country insist upon) – well – how utterly absurd 80% of my 'busyness<i>' </i>is! One does not realize it when going from job to job, and from person to person during the day, and so one keeps on being increasingly 'busy' in this fool way, and increasingly harassed and overcome by said 'busyness'</p>
<p>But truly the Annex building to the Library has almost killed me - The damned thing will be finished some time in June or early in July</p>
