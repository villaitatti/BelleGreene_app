<p>remember of having been so miserable except on the day, eight years ago, when they brought his body back to the Library. I miss him more every year and on days like yesterday & today, it is almost unbearable. The cemetery is miles from the city of Hartford and the intervening country dreary or hideous â€“ By the time I reached his tomb I wanted nothing but to creep in and stay there with him forever.</p>
<p>Returning I met Junius Morgan at the station. He also out been out there</p>
