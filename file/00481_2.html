<p>remember of having been so miserable except on the day, eight years ago, when they brought his body back to the Library.I miss him more every year and on days like yesterday&today, it is almost unbearable. The cemetery is miles from the city of Hartford and the intervening country dreary or hideous – By the time I reached his tomb I wanted nothing but to creep in and stay there with him forever.</p>
<p>Returning I met Junius Morgan at the station. He also out been out there</p>
