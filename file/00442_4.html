<p>very great feather in his cap – he stormed and raged and finally (honestly) <u>wept</u> at my decision never to allow him in that room again – but I was adamant – I have my manuscript catalogue under way and most certainly <u>he</u> is not going "butt <u>in</u>" on it. </p>
<p>As I before said, he has adopted an entirely new attitude this time – has never once mentioned the MSS. and, as he tells me, his <u>only</u> desire in life is to lay him self [sic] at my feet, like a devoted and obedient little dog – You can imagine how such an attitude nauseates me –</p>
<p>He pretends to be perfectly crazy about me personally – but I have not the <u>slightest</u> faith (<u>nor</u> interest) in it – I know perfectly well when a man is really devoted to me or "mad" about me & Ricci is neither. He's <u>only</u> mad about himself – the point is that he realizes that in <u>his</u> world (of books, owners, collectors etc.) I am something of a power – He always takes pains to tell these people, here or in London, that he knows me very well and it is most amusing to hear the stuff they repeat to me – But I am sure that his "craze" for me would never interfere for a second (nor for a centime)</p>
