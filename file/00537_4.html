<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>like to buy the Milka Gospels & the Lambronien Gospels (XII cent.) but I hear that they are <u>very</u> rich & above price – also I've no. 6 from the Greci – but there is no chance of either – As to the Marciano, I am rather lost – I have looked at too much each time so for & so hereafter am only going to see one thing – Unfortunately (for me) both Lafontaine & the chief Librarian are away on "permission" for the month of August – & I don't like the assistant who spends all his time looking at my drooping breasts – in fact I <u>dislike</u> him so much that I rather hate to go there, for they have a system whereby they let him know the minute I arrive & he just hangs around with his eyes glued to my nipples every moment – I <u>loathe</u> him </p>
<p>I love the Frari & the head-father & I are <u>intimate</u> – I don't give a damn for the Titian assumption, but I <u>adore</u> that Bellini (even if you despise it) and the marble choir screen & those divine bronze figures in the holy-water basins – & – well <u>all</u> of it – He gave me a 'box' for the Vespers on Assumption Day & was tickled to death that I followed at his side (<u>most</u> respectfully) during the evening procession—</p>
<p>BB – I [<i>double underlined</i>: hate]the general interior of San Marco. Is it old age? – or what? I loathe it – You might have known that I hugged those "hugging" porphyrys at first sight & the enamels of the Palo d'ovo – & some bronzes— & [<i>double underlined</i>: all] the stones – but – Gawd damn <u>the rest!!</u> I send the enclosed – so that you will read & digest it & not bother me with questions about all these RIFFIANS when I see you – I take that book. The RIFFIANS are gentlemen, scholars, & aristocrats beside them</p>
