<p><u>Friday, May 14</u></p>
<p>Dearest B. B. –</p>
<p>This is the first day since last Friday when we received the dreadful news of the Lusitania that I have had the courage <s>to</s> and heart to write. By the way I sent you the longest letter I have almost ever written you by that boat and also a small "lumière" plate that had been taken of me in the orange tea gown you hate so much – the color scheme was really wonderful very "Matissey" and I knew </p>

<p>you would love it</p>
<p>I do not think that <u>anything</u> since the outbreak of the war has affected me as has this last murderous trick – the feeling here is <u>very</u> strong – Every one is tense with foreboding and everyone goes about very quietly and carefully as if one were walking on bombs! The feeling runs so strong against Germany that we all realize our only safety <s>is</s> lies in absolute silence – no one wants to "rock the ship" for we all realize that it need only a tiny spark to set afire a huge anti-German blaze in this country and with our millions of German inhabitants</p>
