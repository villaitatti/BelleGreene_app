<p>say that you would come here if you could – of course Darling, I am, more or less <u>living </u>for that – In fact the hope of seeing you before the year is over has given <u>quite</u> a new zest to life for me – I want you & to be with you, more than I can <u>possibly</u> write. My need of you seems to become more imperative every day and it would mean <u>everything</u> to me to be with you for a month or two every year – all this is</p>
<p>[p. 15]</p>
<p>absolutely true and yet, not for one minute, do I want you to come over, if it is not absolutely right & easy for you to do so –</p>
<p>Only if you <u>do</u> find you are able to come, my heart & my mind & my body will be joyously singing – there is no question of my love for you – or the length or depth of it. Only I do want terribly to make up for all the time when I didn’t <u>love you</u> enough –</p>
