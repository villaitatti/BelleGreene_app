<p>say you got their incredibly poor reproduction of the Canon tables & 4 Evang. In the gospels of Milka – Now that one knows the original, the reprod. is a helpful reminder – Let me know if you have not got this & I will bring one – I have given them the copy of the only one of your books I had with me – The 3rd ed of the Venetian Painters  & they are <u>dying</u> for the others for their library – Haven't you got the other 3 vols. in the <u>small</u> edition to send them with your compliments – also the tirages a part of the Dedalo, Gazette & other things?
