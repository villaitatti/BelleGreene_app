<p>well be in an Island in the Pacific, as within 2 1/2 hours of New York – There is nothing but water and a lighthouse to be seen and not a human but my sister and the servants – all of whom keep miles away from me – this scrawl is being made on the beach with some vile brownish fluid <u>called</u> ink– so scuse please –</p>
<p>I think that I wrote you that my small sister Teddy has an A.1 – <u>peach</u> of a boy – He is a bit too blond to <u>absolutely</u> suit me as I'm not awfully keen about a blue eyed golden haired man – but as his eyelashes (too <u>divinely</u> long and curling) are black I'm hoping that in time his hair will turn black also, when, <u>believe me</u> , he will be some beauty –</p>
<p>Of course I'm quite crazy about him – not at all on account of this looks – which is what attracts everyone else – but because of his truly amazing intelligence – Its almost uncanny and sometimes he does make me fearful</p>
