<p>as, because of my change of plans, I cannot stay there for more than three or four days in March – but I shall return some time in May, or the end of April. Also I do not know anything of the conditions at the Vatican & want to test all those things out on my <u>first</u> trip. The Pope has taken his entire lot of our MSS. to his Holy Bosom – why, we cannot as yet decide – & is doing all sorts of wonderful and gratuitous things for us. <u>That also</u> I must fathom if possible –</p>
<p>I will not try to get to Settignano under the circumstances</p>
