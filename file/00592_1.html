<p>I Tatti, Settignano</p>
<p>Florence, Italy</p>
<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I certainly should have written you earlier to thank you <u>ever</u> so much for the beautiful set of your DRAWINGS OF THE FLORENTINE PAINTERS, which John Shapley bought here, and <u>reverently</u> placed in my hands.</p>
<p>There are no words of praise sufficiently strong to express my admiration for this tremendously important work. Will you believe me when I tell you that I have <u>read</u> at least half of the volume of text, and “skimmed though” the remainder with a real thrill. I think that with the exception of my favorite, St. Francis (a Sienese painter of the Franciscan Legend, in case you have forgotten it!) this text is the grandest, most inspired of all your writings, --- and I love the witty, occasionally biting, B.B. touches throughout. Who but B.B. could write that wonderful paragraph comparing our Spinello drawing with Chinese draughtmanship, and a “dig” at the raving collectors thereof.</p>
<p>I cheered every word of Royal Cortissoz’ review in the Herald Tribune as I read it -- <u>and have framed it on the</u> fly-leaf of Volume One.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we were asked to send photographs of the so-called Cellini sketch-book, to someone in Florence. I said that I could not do so, but that I would send you a set for deposit in your library, where the gent <u>might</u> be able to consult them. I have had photographs taken, but alas, they seem to be absolutely useless. I am having them rephotographed, and if the results are better, will ship them on to you.</p>
<p>Heaps of affection to you, and a million congratulations,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
<p>P.S. <u>I</u> vote for custody of the “two homeless males” (no. 203h)!</p>
