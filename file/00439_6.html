<p>I like their talk – Your friend de Ricci writes me that he is sailing for our shores on the 25 of this month but I am pretty sure that he <u>won't</u> as the boat he had intended to take, has been held up by the strike here & has not even left our port for its return journey  – I thank thee Lord for the brief respite – your letters might conceivably be more <u>bulky.</u> </p>
