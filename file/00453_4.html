<p>Now I want to tell you something to put under your hat and keep to yourself – which is that <s>the</s> Duncan Grant & “ <u>Mrs</u> .” talked <u>very</u> critically and ungenerously of you and Mary. Not to me, for I have not seen them at all, but I heard it <u>direct</u> and I was <u>perfectly furious</u> after all your kindness to that miserable worm of a woman. It seems that in Paris, she and Grant and Clive Belle & <u>his</u> lady were all stopping in the same hotel! Can you beat it?</p>
<p>I took a “night off” and went with René Gimpel and his wife to see the real Mont Martre and enjoyed it more than any frivolous thing I did here – Mme. G – is a horrid insipid little sheeny. I think someone told me a [sic] Duveen I never would have gone had I known that <u>she</u> would be along but Gimpel I have always liked and aside from d'Hendecourt the only dealer</p>
