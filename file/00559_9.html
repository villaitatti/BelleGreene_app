<p>our dear Joe selling the 4 Duccio’s for more than he paid them for the entire collection (if he <u>has</u> paid them!) and some of their other pictures at simply <u>unbelievable</u> sums? </p>
<p>I hear that his Raphael ‘Medicis’ portrait is still wandering (having been returned by Mellon), but that there is a large chance that Ford will buy it – or by now has done so –</p>
<p>I went to Friedsam’sfor the first time the other night when Mrs. Murray Crane staged a party there in the guise – or under the camouflage – of a lecture by Walter Cookon mediaeval Spanish mural painting – I assure you that never before has he had such Sassiety in his house – He has some <u>excellent</u> Flemish paintings and one or two good Italians – and one or two (<u>really</u> more) other good things – and heaps of junk – </p>
<p>No one (except Kleinberger) who was there, had ever been in the house before including Robinson – speaking of that Gottverdamtermuseum<i>, </i>Breckis going off with Porter, as is also Goldschmidt </p>
