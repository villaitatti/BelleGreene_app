<p>Dear B. B. -</p>
<p>Wouldit botheryou <u>very</u> much to write a letter to Eugene Meyer (jr.) givinghimyour opinion of the Educational value and importance of the Freer collection? He is so t <u>u</u> rribly keen on getting a degree from Yale for Freer and of course, a (nice) letter</p>
<p>[p.2]</p>
<p>from you would be so valuable –</p>
<p>Any timewithin the next week would do – perhaps you would find a moment at Northampton in which to compose it –</p>
<p>But – please “me dearling” <u>don't</u> do it – unless you feel that it is fully justified –</p>
<p>I am just “beating it” for me Virgin</p>
