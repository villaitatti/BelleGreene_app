<p>the large accumulation of “regular stuff” which they already possess, they naturally need only give their attention to fine choice specimens, therefore, in time, I expect they will be able to make a magnificent showing.</p>
<p>Lodge has been <u>relentless</u> in recataloging [sic] the stuff (oh! it is so largely ‘ <u>stuff</u> ’) and all – rather a large majority, of Freer’s great things have sunk into the peaceful ocean of “15th-16th century” or later. The Ku-khai-chi – is (thank God) now labelled – “12th century copy of 4-5 cent. in style of K.K.e.” – the famous Ma Yüan (you remember Freer gave us each a facsimile reprod. with notes by Binyon?) is now at home in the “late Ming dynasty – <u>after</u> an original design by Ma. Yüan” etc. and so it goes, throughout the lot – I highly approve of all this straightening out if it will be substantiated – but of course have no knowledge of my own in the matter – I do strongly feel however, that practically <u>every</u> collection would suffer the same treatment at Lodge’s hands  In fact he intimated to me that he had neither seen nor heard of any <s>thin</s> g [^collection^] which would average up any better than Freer’s –
Of course my dismayed disappointment was due to the fact that in all the departments represented – with the possible exception of the sculpture – I had seen such far finer, (individual) examples – I laughed aloud when looking at</p>
