<p>[p. 3]</p>
<p>Antonello, is the only one of the 3 subjects of which I have seen the original, and your argument there is finally convincing in every respect except (as you state & admit) the date – 1510 or 1910? I think the general reader will be left with an impression of the latter date, which may have been your intention?</p>
<p>I will have these proof sheets etc. returned to you as soon as I reach N.Y. & will eagerly <u>await</u> the book publication</p>
<p>Several days ago we had 2 days of a <u>storm</u> such as I have never dreamed of – and I must admit that it was most <u>amazing</u> the way this boat rode it – The manager of the Swedish line is on board, and he told me that he did not know of another boat, on <u>any</u> line, which could have equalled it – I have never been in a heavy storm at sea, and as I was one of the few on board who had never a qualm of seasickness I found it wonderful! The waves were thrown up & over the top deck – but we just walked through them, as something to be brushed aside – They tell me that we are to have another greatandglorious reception on our arrival tomorrow or (more likely) Saturday morning – I shall never forget the one at Naples the afternoon we left as long as I live</p>
