<p>Friday, July 2 – 1915</p>
<p>Dearest B. B.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of June 14th from Fiuggi – a <u>very</u> interesting letter by the way – In it you speak of a cable sent me evidently a month previous – I have <u>never</u> received it – of course I am<s>so</s> cross that you are quite happy in Italy and have no desire to come over here – Does that mean you are <u>not</u> coming in the fall? I had </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>so much looked forward to seeing you at the <u>latest</u> in October and if you don't come then I shall <u>really</u> be in despair – Do you realize it is two whole years since I have seen you and that I really cannot [<i>inserted: </i>continue] living in my love for you if I <u>don't</u> see you oftener?</p>
<p>You perhaps will smile sarcastically when you read that, but it is really true – It does not</p>
